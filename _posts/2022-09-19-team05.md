## Project Proposal 

In this project we will investigate **self-play for compettive Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. Different from single-agent systems, the evolution of the environmental state and the reward function that each agent received are not only determined by the envrionment, but also other agents' joint actions. As a result, agents need to take into account and interact with not only the environment but also other intelligent agents (see Fig. 1). In a multi-agents scenario, there could be cooperation (e.g., May and Cody in video game *It Takes Two*) and competition (e.g., most of board games).

Concretely, our target is to implement a toy 2 vs 2 soccer game in Unity (as shown in Fig. 2). In this game, there are two teams with two agents in each. The goal is to get the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing the ball from entering own goal.

To achive this, we are going to firstly build up the soccer environment in Unity [2]. Then we plan to create a 1 vs 1 soccer game to investigate the behaviors of competition. After the 1 vs 1 scenario works, we will handle the 2 vs 2 soccer game which involves cooperation too.

We plan to try different MARL algorithms and analyse their behaivors:

- TODO

We will also create a GUI to allow users to flight with RL agents, if time allows.

It is possible that some algorithms don't work well in the soccer settings. We will try to finetune the hyper-parameters and analyse why some of the algorithms fail.

By this project, we hope to provide a easy-to-use multi-agent environment and plug-and-play MARL algorithms to class and also, give detailed analysis of behaviors of MARL agents to readers.
