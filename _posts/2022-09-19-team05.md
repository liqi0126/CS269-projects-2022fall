> In this project we are going to investiage **self-play for competitive Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. We will explore the power of self-play on stablizing multi-agent training on several settings including soccer game, Multi-agent tennis, competitive Atari Game Pone, competitive Car-racing, etc. Among them, we build a 2 vs 2 soccer game in Unity and try different MARL algorithms on it. We provide the source code and detailed analysis.

## What is MARL?
In this project, we investigate **self-play for competitive Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL)**. Different from single-agent systems, where a stationary environment is possible, the evolution of the environmental state and the reward function that each agent received are not only determined by the envrionment, but also other agents' joint actions. As a result, agents need to take into account and interact with not only the environment but also other intelligent agents (see Fig. 1). In a multi-agents scenario, there could be cooperation (e.g., May and Cody in video game *It Takes Two*) and competition (e.g., most of board games).

Competitive multi-agent algorithms are widely applicable, with particular interest in a variety of board, sports, or computer games including Chess, Mahjong, Soccer, Starcraft, etc. However, training agents to perform complex tasks requires high complexity of the environment, which is in general hard to achieve in regular training environments. Self-play is a concept that can be dated back to TD-gammon and has been explored to fit real tasks in AlphaGo, Dota2, etc. In a self-play game, the opponent agent are providing sufficient diversified responses, which resolves the issue of the lack of complexity in the environment. Moreover, the opponent agent are providing the trained agent with the right curriculum to learn.

### POCA
[MA-POCA](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2111.05992.pdf) (MultiAgent POsthumous Credit Assignment) is a neural network that acts as a "coach" for a whole group of agents. Since Muti-Agent game needs to be considered with functionality for training cooperative behaviors - i.e., groups of agents working towards a common goal, where the success of the individual is linked to the success of the whole group. In such a scenario, agents typically receive rewards as a group. You can give rewards to the team as a whole, and the agents will learn how best to contribute to achieving that reward. Agents can also be given rewards individually, and the team will work together to help the individual achieve those goals.

  <img width="90%" src="../../../assets/images/team05/poca.png">
  <figcaption>Fig 2. three actors select actions based on the observations of a single agent, while a single critic evaluates the behavior of the whole group for training. [2].</figcaption>
</figure>

During an episode, agents can be added or removed from the group, such as when agents spawn or die in a game. If agents are removed mid-episode (e.g., if teammates die or are removed from the game), they will still learn whether their actions contributed to the team winning later, enabling agents to take group-beneficial actions even if they result in the individual being removed from the game (i.e., self-sacrifice). MA-POCA can also be combined with self-play to train teams of agents to play against each other.

## Challenges and Solution

We implement a toy 2 vs 2 soccer game in Unity (as shown in Fig. 2) and investigate the performance of self-play. In this game, there are two teams with two agents in each. The goal is to get the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing the ball from entering own goal.

<figure align="center">
  <img width="80%" src="../../../assets/images/team05/soccer.png">
  <figcaption>Fig 2. 2 vs 2 soccer game in Unity.</figcaption>
</figure>

Now, we have the following question:

- How to control the role separately?
  
A challenge that we are facing in training for the two-soccer game is that we need to train more than one brain at a time, e.g. there is a goalie that needs a defensive brain and a striker that needs an offensive brain. So we need different reward functions to train different controllers. By enabling the multi-brain training feature in the ML-Agents toolkit of Unity, we are building our algorithms based on not only a two-player setting, but also each player has two brains present. After training, we get one neural network model for each brain, that further enables mixing and matching different hyperparameters.

- How to train the antagonism between both sides?
  
Since there could exist a situation that two-side players do not move all the time that making the game meaningless, it is important to consider how to train the adversarial between two players, we propose to experiment with using the self-play technique to enhance the performance. We will analyze how the two-brain setting affects the training, as well as how the self-play affects the training.

## Unity Environment Setup (borrowed from [here](https://github.com/bryanoliveira/soccer-twos-env))

The environment is based on Unity ML Agents' [Soccer Twos](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents/blob/92ff2c26fef7174b443115454fa1c6045d622bc2/docs/Learning-Environment-Examples.md#soccer-twos), so most of the specs are the same. Here, four agents compete in a 2 vs 2 toy soccer game, aiming to get the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing the ball from entering own goal.

- **Goal**: Get the ball into the opponent's goal while preventing the ball from entering own goal.
  
- **Agent Reward Function**:
  - `1 - accumulated time penalty`: when ball enters opponent's goal. Accumulated time penalty is incremented by `(1 / MaxSteps)` every fixed update and is reset to 0 at the beginning of an episode. In this build, `MaxSteps = 5000`.
  - `-1`: when ball enters team's goal.

- **Observation space**: 336 corresponding to 11 ray-casts forward distributed over 120 degrees (264) and 3 ray-casts backward distributed over 90 degrees each detecting 6 possible object types, along with the object's distance. The forward ray-casts contribute 264 state dimensions and backward 72 state dimensions.

- **Action space**: 3 discrete branched actions (MultiDiscrete) corresponding to forward, backward, sideways movement, as well as rotation (27 discrete actions).

### MAPOCA

In the next two fitures we present our training curve of the POCA algorithm on the two-player soccer game environment. Figure 3 shows the training error during training and Figure 4 shows the group cumulative rewards across the training process.

</figure>

In the video below, we demonstrate the behavior of our trained agent. We see that it follows similar behavior as the example video above. The goalie stays around the gate to defend when the ball gets close to the gate, and the striker moves intensively across the field. However, we notice that the role of the goalie and the striker is switching during an episode, meaning that sometimes the goalie moves forward to shoot. We anticipate that this is due to improper assignment of goals for the defenser and the attacker. We will try solving this issue and improving the performance in the upcoming weeks.
